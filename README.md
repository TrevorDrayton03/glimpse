# GLIMPSE
## About
GLIMPSE is a web application designed to detect glaucoma using fundus images. The primary use case for GLIMPSE is to facilitate early detection of glaucoma, enabling healthcare professionals to swiftly identify potential signs of the disease. By leveraging fundus photography and machine learning, including images captured with smartphones, GLIMPSE helps healthcare providers to determine whether a referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted for assessment.
